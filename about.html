        <h3><i>Problem</i></h3>
        
        <p>
In the midst of a panic attack, it can often be difficult to discern exactly what actions to take to solve the problem.  As your heart rate skyrockets and your breathing becomes jagged, your thoughts become broken and disjointed.  In the back of your mind, you know that you should try to take deep breaths and possibly contact a friend or family member, but it seems physically impossible to do so without any aid.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Concept</i></h3>
        <p>
            <i>Chill</i> utilizes the wahoo fitness BlueHR device to monitor the user’s heart and respiratory rates, and takes action when symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks are apparent.  Such actions might include recommending breathing exercises, medications, and messaging a chosen contact.  Anxiety attacks will then be logged in the application depending on severity as judged by both the user and the sensors for the user’s future reference and medical records.

        <h3><i>Marketability</i></h3>
        <p>
According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting more than forty million adults in the U.S. alone.  While anxiety disorders are highly treatable, only about one-third of those suffering receive treatment.  People with an anxiety disorder are five times more likely to go to the doctor and six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders than those who do not suffer from anxiety disorders.  Our application would be widely marketable to those forty million adults, as well as to minors not included in such statistics.

        <h3><i>Future</i></h3>
        <p>
In the future, <i>chill</i> would like to develop its own low-cost, low-energy sensors in order to maximize product accessibility, as well as develop an Android application and web-based application. We are excited to watch as chill revolutionizes the worlds of those with anxiety.
